            <h2>Course Overview and Rationale</h2>
            <p>The rapid development and deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have disrupted traditional legal frameworks, making existing legislation and case law obsolete or conflicting with new AI capabilities.</p>
            <p>This course explores:
                <br>(1) This new legal paradigm and the urgent need to regulate these gaps and establish technical and safety agreements in AI.
                <br>(2) The different legislator approaches adopted so far by the key global players including the United Sates, European Union, United Kingdom and China and the unique challenges and opportunities for policymakers and regulators.
            </p>
            <p>By examining these diverse regulatory environments, participants will gain a comprehensive understanding of how different regions are addressing the ethical, economic, safety and social implications of AI technologies while trying to promote innovation.</p>
            <p>By the end of this course, participants will have a strong understanding of the nuance implications and challenges of AI on key pre-existing laws and how different regions are attempting to shape the future of AI and mitigate current legal and social concerns.</p>

                <h3>Session 5: Liability Allocation</h3>
                <p>In this session, we will explore the complex and critical issue of liability allocation in the context of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. As AI technologies become increasingly integrated into various sectors, determining who is responsible when these systems cause harm or fail to perform as expected becomes paramount. This includes establishing the liability regime for downstream developers and “fine-tuners” of frontier models and a duty of care for the main developer to oversee the downstream uses of its system. Clear liability allocation is an essential legal requirement for the effective and successful implementation of all legal frameworks across every domain. This session will examine the different legal frameworks and approaches to allocating liability for AI-induced damages, considering perspectives from various jurisdictions. Participants will delve into the key challenges of attributing liability and different liability models and their applicability in the context of AI.</p>
